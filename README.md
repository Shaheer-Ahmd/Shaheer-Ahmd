# Hello there! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">

I am a B.Sc Computer Science student at LUMS and I like developing software that makes systems more secure and robust.

I try to contribute to open source projects in my free time. Some of my open source contributions are below:

- **Inspektor Gadget** (eBPF based Kubernetes observability tool - 2.7k Stars) | [Link to PRs](https://github.com/inspektor-gadget/inspektor-gadget/pulls?q=is%3Aany+is%3Apr+author%3AShaheer-Ahmd+)
  - This involvement started during a three month menteeship at the **Linux Foundation** under the supervision of **Microsoft Engineers**.
  - I implemented end-to-end tests for four core gadgets.
  - I also strengthened the tool's infrastructure by applying the **dependency inversion principle** throughout the Go codebase, which enabled comprehensive unit tests for six core operators and raised test coverage from 0% to 94% average.
  - I then engineered a new “Snapshot File” gadget, which uses the `task_file` BPF iterator to capture a snapshot of all open files, a critical capability for runtime security auditing and container inspection.

- **Astropy (Python Software Foundation subproject - 5k stars)**
  - Fixed the RUFF violation "unconventional import alias: ICN001" in the subproject's entire codebase. [Link to PR](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/pull/15899)

- **Current Focus**
  - These days, I am exploring **LLVM Compiler Infrastructure** and will be contributing to it.
